## Chapter 7 - Advanced Style Sheets

**Discussion:** In Chapter 7, we will explore advanced techniques and features of cascading style sheets.

1. Complete the chapter tutorial on pages 324-351 using the files in the chapter/ folder.
1. Complete Lab 3 with the following changes:
  a. You can use any three images you like to tell any story.
  b. Resize the images to 260 by 195 pixels (as they are in the lab). If you have any questions about how to to do this, let the instructor know.
  c. All other aspects of the lab should work with these loosened constraints.
  d. You may choose to use the files in the labs/ folder if you wish.

When you are finished, push the entire repository back to github.
